Implementing a router with two parts:
	1) Dataplane, which does the actual routing.
	2) Control plane

Main contributions were in coding the dataplane part of the project.
The router has multiple interfaces and can received packets on each of them. 
It has to send the packet further, with the routing table rules. 
The fundamentals of this projects were understading the use of protocols such as IP, ARP and ICMP.
